
The Datetimepicker is a plugin that works on the base of JQuery and adds date- and timepicker functionality to your pages. 
You can customize the date format and language, restrict the selectable date ranges and add in buttons and other navigation 
options.

By default, the datepicker calendar and timepicker open in a small overlay when the associated text field gains focus. 
For an inline calendar and time, simply attach the datetimepicker to a div or span.

The plugin includes jquery-ui.min.css, jquery-3.1.1.min.js, jquery-ui.min.js in your page.
"Options" is an optional javascript object with parameters.
